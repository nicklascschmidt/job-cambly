/** Prompt

Given a string of text, write a program that prints a list of unique words contained in the string
along with the number of occurrences of each word in the string. The list should be sorted in
descending order by frequency, and ascending order alphabetically when multiple words occur
with the same frequency.

expected output:
  test 3
  a 2
  is 2
  not 1
  that 1
  this 1

Because while we could never ensure that our children would be rich or successful; while we could never be positive that they would do better than their parents, America is about making it possible to give them the chance. To give every child the opportunity to try. Education is still the foundation of this opportunity. And the most basic building block that holds that foundation together is still reading. At the dawn of the 21st century, in a world where knowledge truly is power and literacy is the skill that unlocks the gates of opportunity and success, we all have a responsibility as parents and librarians, educators and citizens, to instill in our children a love of reading so that we can give them the chance to fulfill their dreams.';
